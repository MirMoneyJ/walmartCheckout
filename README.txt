Checkout Bot for Walmart(GUEST CHECKOUT)

This program performs an 'autocomplete' of the neccessary information
needed make a purchase on the Walmart website using Node.js and Puppeteer.
In this program, you will enter your credentials, and the link of the item
that you want. When you run the bot, it will automatically fill in the information.
The purpose of this project
is to make it easier for me to checkout items that I want.
**Eventually I'll create a webpage that you can input this info into**
